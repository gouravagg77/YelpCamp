# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a website where users can create campgrounds and can comment on campgrounds. In order to review or create a campground, user should be logged in. If a user didnâ€™t have an account, he/she must sign-up before logging in. This
project was part of Colt Steele's web development course on Udemy.
This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication.
